# Squad-Up

React Native mobile application built with Expo, TypeScript, and NativeWind.

## Project Structure

This project follows a component-driven architecture with Atomic Design principles:

- `app/` - Expo Router file-based routing
- `components/` - Reusable UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- `constants/` - Theme, colors, spacing configurations
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `data/` - Mock data for development
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `assets/` - Images, icons, fonts

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Tech Stack

- **Expo** - React Native framework
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **NativeWind** - Tailwind CSS for React Native
